## Running ecFlow in a container on MacOS
This is a guide to running ecFlow in a container on MacOS.

Modify 'servers.txt' to point to the ecFlow server you want to use.

'session.json' and 'settings.json' are used to configure the ecFlow UI.

See 'run.sh' for instructions on how to build and run the container. Note that you must have x11 installed on your Mac, which is required to run the UI from the container.
